public class FindPeakElement {
/*  binary search
    A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
    Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
    You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
